# Resources
Resources are the items that ${project.name} views or edits. Resources can be 
almost anything from text files, images, mazes, drawings, etc. However, a
resource type must be registered with ${project.name} to indicate that it is
supported.
 
# Resource Types
Resource types represent internal data models for ${project.name}. While the 
resource type is not the data model, it is a placeholder in the resource
management system for the supported data models. When opening an existing
resource or creating a new resource, the resource type is either specified
or resolved for the resource. The resource type is also associated to the 
codecs that can read or write the data model the resource type represents.
