	<p>2019-11-29</p>

	<p>
		There are several ways that you can get involved with the Xenon project.
		Here are some suggestions:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Submit a bug report</li>
		<li>Create a Mod</li>
		<li>Create a pull request</li>
	</ul>

	<h2 id="submit-bug-report">Submitting Bug Reports</h2>
	<p>
		Since the project is hosted on GitHub, we use the
		<a href="https://github.com/avereon/xenon/issues">GitHub issue tracking</a>.
		When submitting a bug please give as much information about the problem as
		possible. Screenshots or videos are also helpful when demonstrating a
		problem. Also report what version of Xenon you are using and what mods you
		have installed (both enabled and disabled).
	</p>

	<h2 id="create-a-mod">Create a Mod</h2>
	<p>
		Xenon depends on mods from people like you who can provide creative tools
		and features. If you already program in Java, building a mod is pretty easy.
		If you are not a programmer, this just might be the time to get started.
		Check out the <a href="/product/xenon/docs/mods">mod development
		instructions</a> for further information.
	</p>

	<h2 id="create-a-pull-request">Create a Pull Request</h2>
	<p>
		If you familiar with Java development please consider forking the Xenon
		project and providing pull requests for bug fixes and new features. If you
		would like to coordinate with the project team please contact them through
		the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/avereon/teams/xenon">Xenon GitHub team</a>.
