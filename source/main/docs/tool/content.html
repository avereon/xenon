	<h3>
		Updating the tool state when the asset changes
	</h3>
	<p>
		The recommended way to update the tool state when the asset changes is to
		register event handlers on the asset model for the changes the tool needs
		in order to keep the state up-to-date. Registering event handlers on the
		asset will provide high-level update notifications, but will not provide
		enough information for the tool to make efficient decisions. Also keep in
		mind that there may be other tools also watching the asset model.
