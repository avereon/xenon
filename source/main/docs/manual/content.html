	<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>

	<p>
		Welcome, and thank you for using Xenon. Xenon is a simple application
		framework that provides services common to modern desktop applications
		like selection tabs, dockable work areas, notifications and many others.
		We hope you find the framework useful as you get to know its features and
		capabilities. We particularly encourage you to <a href="/product/xenon/modules">
		discover the modules</a> available for Xenon that provide capabilities to
		accomplish all kinds of tasks.
	</p>

	</a>

	<h3 id="download-and-install">Download and Install</h3>
	<p>
		If you are new to Xenon, the installers for current versions are found on
		the <a href='/product/xenon'>Xenon product page</a>. Once downloaded, run
		the installer to install Xenon. When installed Xenon can be found by
		searching for Xenon in the start menu or application finder of your
		operating system.
	</p>

	<h3 id="terminology">Terminology</h3>
	<p>
		In the course of reading this document, you will run across a number of terms
		that have specific meaning in Xenon. This section serves as a brief introduction
		to some of the concepts and terminology used in Xenon as well as an explanation
		for each.
	</p>

	<dl>
		<dt id="terminology-program">Program</dt>
		<dd>Xenon uses the term 'program' to refer to the program itself. This term
			is used in place of 'application' for simplicity and to avoid ambiguity
			with the term application or app.
		</dd>
	</dl>
	<dl>
		<dt id="terminology-resource">Resource</dt>
		<dd>
			A resource is something on which Xenon operates. Specifically resources
			are things that are 'opened' and 'closed' and sometimes 'loaded' and
			'saved'. Resources are defined by Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) and
			a URI is used to identify a specific resource to Xenon. Some examples of
			resources are:
			<ul>
				<li>An SSH connection to another computer.</li>
				<li>A file on the local file system.</li>
				<li>The built-in about resource.</li>
			</ul>
		</dd>
	</dl>
	<dl>
		<dt id="terminology-resource-type">Resource Type</dt>
		<dd>
			Resources are always assigned a resource type in order to identify what
			tools are available for that resource. If a resource type cannot be
			determined then Xenon is unable to operate on that resource. Resource
			types are also used to determine what tools can be used on a particular
			resource. Resource types are very similar to media types as defined by IANA
			(<a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml">https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml</a>)
			and are commonly associated directly with a media type.
		</dd>
	</dl>
	<dl>
		<dt id="terminology-workspace">Workspace</dt>
		<dd>
			A workspace is everything in a Xenon window. Xenon allows multiple
			workspaces to be open at any given time. Workspaces allow the user to
			switch between workareas quickly.
		</dd>
	</dl>
	<dl>
		<dt id="terminology-workarea">Workarea</dt>
		<dd>
			A workarea is a named collection and layout of tools.
		</dd>
	</dl>
	<dl>
		<dt id="terminology-tool">Tool</dt>
		<dd>
			A tool is a graphical component that provides specific functionality to
			operate on a resource. Some examples of tools are: a text editor, an image
			viewer, a calculator and an SSH terminal. Tools are provided and
			implemented by modules.
		</dd>
	</dl>
	<dl>
		<dt id="terminology-action">Action</dt>
		<dd>
			Actions define the set of operations that can be used with tools. Many
			actions are common among tools (e.d. cut, copy, paste) and some actions
			are specific. Tools use common actions to provide a simpler user
			experience.
		</dd>
	</dl>
	<dl>
		<dt id="terminology-program-data-folder">Program Data Folder</dt>
		<dd>
			This is the location where the program configuration and other files that
			are not part of the program itself are located. The location of the
			program home folder is different across platforms but the structure is the
			same. The following table shows the default program data folder location
			for common platforms:
			<table>
				<tr>
					<td>Linux</td>
					<td>$HOME/.config/xenon</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Mac OS</td>
					<td>$HOME/Library/Application Support/Xenon</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Windows</td>
					<td>%HOME%\AppData\Roaming\Xenon</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		</dd>
	</dl>
	<dl>
		<dt id="terminology-program-home-folder">Program Home Folder</dt>
		<dd>
			This is the location where the program is installed and from where the program
			executes. The location of the program home is different across platforms but
			the structure is the same. The following table shows the default program home
			location for common platforms:
			<table>
				<tr>
					<td>Linux</td>
					<td>$HOME/.local/share/xenon</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Mac OS</td>
					<td>/Applications/Xenon.app/Contents</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Windows</td>
					<td>C:\Program Files\Xenon</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		</dd>
	</dl>
	<dl>
		<dt id="terminology-product">Product</dt>
		<dd>
			The program and modules are collectively referred to as products. You will notice
			that program updates and modules updates are handled with the same tools and
			workflow. Anytime you see the term product it may refer to either the program,
			modules or both.
		</dd>
	</dl>
	<dl>
		<dt id="terminology-modules">Modules</dt>
		<dd>
			A modules is a binary package that provides specific functionality. In
			specific, it provides tools to operate on resources. Mods may also provide
			additional resource types and actions that can be used by other modules.
		</dd>
	</dl>
	<dl>
		<dt id="terminology-product-market">Product Market</dt>
		<dd>
			A network location, usually on the Internet, where to find available
			products.
		</dd>
	</dl>

	<h2 id="command-line-interface">Command Line Interface</h2>
	<p>
		Xenon provides a command line interface to start and interact with the
		program. The command line interface requires that the program be runnable
		from the command line. It is expected that users use the provided program
		shortcuts and shell scripts such that Xenon may simply be started by using
		the command 'xenon' on the command line from any location. This document
		assumes that Xenon is available to execute in this manner:
	</p>

	<code>xenon [&lt;option&gt;...] [&lt;uri&gt;...]</code>

	<p>
		<em>Advanced</em>: Xenon is a Java module and as such can be started using
		the Java module command line parameters. Xenon has been distributed as a
		jlink-ed program and should be executed using the provided Java runtime. To
		start Xenon using the Java module commands use the following:
	</p>

	<code>${XENON_HOME}/bin/java -m com.avereon.xenon</code>

	<h3 id="cli-uris">URIs (Resources)</h3>
	<p>
		Providing a URI to Xenon on the command line instructs Xenon to treat the
		URI as a resource and attempt to open that resource after starting. Any
		valid URI should be acceptable but may not be able to be supported by Xenon
		if a supporting module has not been installed. Any URI that does not specify
		a scheme will be interpreted as a file URI. Relative URIs will be resolved
		against the <code>user.path</code> system property of the invoking JVM.
	</p>

	<h3 id="basic-options">Basic Options</h3>
	<dl>
		<dt>--help</dt>
		<dd>
			Print the command line help information. This option exits the invoked
			instance immediately upon completion. It does not affect already running
			instances.
		</dd>
	</dl>
	<dl>
		<dt>--version</dt>
		<dd>
			Print the program version information. This option exits the invoked
			instance immediately upon completion. It does not affect already running
			instances.
		</dd>
	</dl>

	<h3 id="control-options">Control Options</h3>
	<p>
		Several options control the operation of the program allowing some level of
		automation. If Xenon is run without any control option then the program is
		simply started normally. If an existing process was started with a profile
		(<a href="#cli-option-profile">see profile option</a>), the control option
		must also provide the same profile name to affect the desired instance.
	</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>--nosplash</dt>
		<dd>
			Start the program without showing the splash screen. This option is
			useful in conjunction with the --daemon option.
		</dd>
	</dl>
	<dl>
		<dt id="cli-option-mode">--mode &lt;name&gt;</dt>
		<dd>
			<p>
				Start the program with the desired mode. Supported modes are <code>test</code>
				and <code>dev</code>. These modes are for development purposes and not
				intended for general use.
			</p>
			<p>
				The <code>test</code> mode changes the following program behavior:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The program is prevented from printing the program header on the command line.</li>
				<li>The program is prevented from running program checks at startup.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				The <code>dev</code> mode changes the following program behavior:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The program adds the Development menu on the menu bar.</li>
				<li>The program adds testing buttons to the Task tool.</li>
				<li>The program uses <code>target/program</code> as the program home folder.</li>
				<li>The program home folder is created at startup if it does not exist.</li>
				<li>The updater folder is changed to <code>target/xenon-updater</code>.</li>
			</ul>
		</dd>
	</dl>
	<dl>
		<dt id="cli-option-profile">--profile &lt;name&gt;</dt>
		<dd>
			Start the program with a named profile. Normally this is not necessary but
			in cases where the user wants to have separate instances of the program
			running at the same time each instance will need a different profile.
		</dd>
	</dl>
	<dl>
		<dt>--daemon</dt>
		<dd>
			Start the program without showing workspaces. This options is useful to
			start the program &quot;in the background&quot; to allow the program to
			be running before the user needs to use it. This option can benefit from
			use of the --nosplash option.
		</dd>
	</dl>
	<dl>
		<dt>--stop</dt>
		<dd>
			Stop the program immediately. Using this option does not prompt the user
			that the program is stopping, will close all workspaces and will attempt
			to terminate the program normally.
		</dd>
	</dl>
	<dl>
		<dt>--status</dt>
		<dd>
			Get the status of the program. If the program is not running then this
			option prints that the program is not running and exits immediately.
			If the program is running, this option prints that the program is running
			and exits this instance of the program immediately, leaving the previously
			running instance as it was.
		</dd>
	</dl>
	<dl>
		<dt>--watch</dt>
		<dd>
			Watch the output of an existing program instance. This instance will
			continue to watch the existing instance until this instance is terminated,
			usually by typing Ctrl-C on the keyboard. It is possible to have multiple
			watching instances for any normal instance.
		</dd>
	</dl>

	<h3 id="logging">Logging</h3>
	<p>
		Log events are published to stdout and to the program log file by default.
	</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>--log-level &lt;level&gt;</dt>
		<dd>
			The level of logging verbosity. The valid log level values are:
			<p>none - Turn off all logging</p>
			<p>error - Problematic events that may leave the program in an unstable state</p>
			<p>warn - Problematic events that usually leave the program in a stable state</p>
			<p>info - Information messages like normal program events (default)</p>
			<p>debug - Extra messages that show high level events</p>
			<p>trace - Extra messages that show low level events</p>
			<p>all - Turn on all logging</p>
		</dd>
	</dl>
	<dl>
		<dt>--log-file &lt;file&gt;</dt>
		<dd>
			The log file location. This changes where the log file will be written
			and, therefore, will not be written in the default location.
		</dd>
	</dl>
	<dl>
		<dt>--log-append</dt>
		<dd>
			Should the log file be appended. If this option is not specified the log
			file will be overwritten each time the program is started.
		</dd>
	</dl>

	<h2 id="appendix-a">Appendix A</h2>
	<h3 id="user-experience-principles">User Experience Principles</h3>
	<h6>HiDPI Monitors</h6>
	<p>Support the use of high DPI monitors over the use of standard DPI
		monitors. Over time the pixel density of monitors had hovered between 80 and
		120 DPI. With the introduction of the Apple Retina display in 2010 the DPI
		increased significantly and now there are many monitors with DPI counts
		above 150.
	</p>
	<h6>Keep the User Context</h6>
	<p>
		Whenever the program is restarted it should return the user to where they
		left off unless the user specifically changes the settings not to. This
		means that the program should open the same workspaces with the same
		workareas with the same tools and resources loaded.
	</p>
