		Actions are the basic user input activity in Xenon. Actions are used to
		perform tasks such as opening a file, saving a file, or printing a file.
		Actions are typically associated with a menu item or a toolbar button.
	</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Add the action data to the action resource bundles.
			<ul>
				<li>You may need to create a new icon for your new action</li>

				<li>Be sure your translations are clear in other languages</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Register the action with the program action manager.</li>
		<li>Create an action class that extends Action.
			<ul>
				<li>Implement the isEnabled() method.</li>
