# Workspaces

The program supports multiple workspaces. Workspaces are composed
of windows, workareas and tools.

- Program
	- Workspace
		- Window
			- Workarea
				- Tool

## Workspace Reader

The workspace reader can restore the entire workspace hierarchy at
the start of the program.

## Workspace Writer

The workspace writer, however, needs to be able to persist pieces of
the workspace individually as they change over time.
