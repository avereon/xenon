	<h1>Mod Guide</h1>
	<p>Updated 2020-01-27</p>

	<p>
		This document is step-by-step instruction to create a Xenon mod. These
		instructions attempt to be both a tutorial and a reference. If you are
		starting a new mod project we recommend following the instructions in
		order. If you are returning for reference please use the index for the
		topic you need.
	</p>
	<p>
		A reference project, <a href="https://github.com/avereon/mazer">Mazer</a>,
		is also available to provide a working reference of a Xenon mod. As you work
		through these instructions, feel free to review this project for
		information.
	</p>

	<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>

	<h3 id="requirements">Requirements</h3>
	<p>
		Xenon requires Java 11 or higher and usually adopts LTS Java versions as
		they are released. Xenon also takes advantage of the Java module system and
		therefore you mod will also need to be a Java module.
	</p>

	<h3 id="project-setup">Project Setup</h3>
	<p>
		To start a new mod project we recommend that you use Maven, or a Maven
		compatible tool like Gradle, to configure the new mod project using an
		existing parent pom to jump start the process. It is possible to set up a
		mod project without using the parent pom but you would have to handle
		quite a bit of configuration on your own.
	</p>

	<h3 id="maven-configuration">Maven Configuration</h3>

	<p>
		Start with an empty folder for your project and create a new pom.xml file.
		Use the template below as the initial content for the pom.xml file and set
		your own groupId, artifactId and version:
	</p>

	<pre>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;

&lt;project
  xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/maven-v4_0_0.xsd"
&gt;

  &lt;modelVersion&gt;4.0.0&lt;/modelVersion&gt;

  &lt;parent&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;com.avereon.pom&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;mod&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;3.0.0-SNAPSHOT&lt;/version&gt;
  &lt;/parent&gt;

  &lt;groupId&gt;[your.group.id]&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;[your.artifact.id]&lt;/artifactId&gt;
  &lt;version&gt;[your.version]&lt;/version&gt;
  &lt;packaging&gt;jar&lt;/packaging&gt;

  &lt;-- The Avereon Maven repository --&gt;
  &lt;repositories&gt;
    &lt;repository&gt;
      &lt;id&gt;avn&lt;/id&gt;
      &lt;url&gt;https://repo.avereon.com/avn&lt;/url&gt;
    &lt;/repository&gt;
  &lt;/repositories&gt;

&lt;/project&gt;</pre>

	<p>
		At the same time you can create the source/main/java folders so that the
		project layout looks like this. Note that the 'source' folder is different
		than the standard Maven 'src' folder. This is the only departure from the
		<a href="https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-standard-directory-layout.html">Maven Standard Directory Layout</a>.:
	</p>

	<pre>pom.xml
source/main/java</pre>

	<p>
		At this point you should be able to use Maven to run an initial build even
		though there isn't much to do. It will at least give you the chance to test
		that your configuration is correct.
	</p>

	<h2 id="mod-implementation">Mod Implementation</h2>

	<h3 id="java-module">Java Module</h3>
	<p>
		Create the Java module info file source/main/java/module-info.java. This
		file defines the Java module requirements and will be updated from time to
		time as needs arise. For now we just need the initial configuration:
	</p>
	<pre>module [your java module name] {
  requires com.avereon.xenon;
  exports [your mod class package] to com.avereon.xenon;
  provides com.avereon.xenon.Mod with [your fully qualified mod class name];
}</pre>
	<p>
		Here is an example using the Mazer project:
	</p>
	<pre>module com.avereon.mazer {
  requires com.avereon.xenon;
  exports com.avereon.mazer to com.avereon.xenon;
  provides com.avereon.xenon.Mod with com.avereon.mazer.Mazer;
}</pre>

	<h3 id="mod-class">Mod Class</h3>
	<p>
		Create your mod class and extend the com.averon.xenon.Mod class:
	</p>
	<pre>package [your package];

import com.avereon.xenon.Mod;

public class [YourModClassName] extends Mod {

}</pre>

	<p>
		Here is an example using the Mazer project:
	</p>
	<pre>package com.avereon.mazer;

import com.avereon.xenon.Mod;

public class Mazer extends Mod {

}</pre>

	<h3 id="mod-card">Mod Card</h3>
	<p>
		Mods use a small file, called a product card, or mod card, as a descriptor.
		Create a new JSON text file,
		<code>source/main/resources/META-INF/product.card</code>,	with the
		following content. Values surrounded by ${...} are replaced by
		Maven at build time. Values surrounded by &lt;...&gt; should be updated
		to use your values. The remaining values, such as packaging, should be left
		as defined:
	</p>
	<pre>{
  "group": "${project.groupId}",
  "artifact": "${project.artifactId}",
  "version": "${project.version}",
  "timestamp": "${project.timestamp}",
  "packaging": "mod",
  "icons": [ "${project.artifactId}", "&lt;https://www.avereon.com/download/stable/avereon/provider/icon&gt;" ],
  "name": "${project.name}",
  "provider": "${project.organization.name}",
  "providerUrl": "${project.organization.url}",
  "inception": "${project.inceptionYear}",
  "summary": "&lt;A program to provide capability&gt;",
  "description": "${project.description}",
  "copyrightSummary": "&lt;All rights reserved.&gt;",
  "licenseSummary": "&lt;${project.name} comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.&gt;",
  "javaVersion": "11",
  "maintainers": [
  {
    "name": "&lt;John Doe&gt;",
    "email": "&lt;john.doe@example.com&gt;",
    "timezone": "&lt;time zone&gt;",
    "organization": "&lt;Example Organization&gt;",
    "organizationUrl": "&lt;https://example.com&gt;",
    "roles": [&lt;"Architect", "Developer"&gt;]
  }
  ],
  "contributors": []
}</pre>
	<p>
		With the mod card in place there is enough
		implementation to build the <a href="#module-library">mod library</a> and
		eventually <a href="#mod-deployment">try it with Xenon</a>.
	</p>

	<h3 id="mod-library">Mod Library</h3>
	<p>
		To build the mod, use Maven
		with the package goal:
	</p>
	<pre>mvn -U clean package</pre>
	<p>
		If all has gone well there is now a jar file (not the sources or javadoc
		jar) in the target folder. This file is your mod library.
	</p>

	<h2 id="mod-deployment">Mod Deployment</h2>
	<h3 id="online-deployment">Online Deployment</h3>
	<p>
		Online deployment is the recommended method to deploy mods. This allows
		users to install your mod and stay up-to-date using the built-in online
		update features of Xenon. While this method requires a bit more effort to
		configure initially, it provides a much better experience for your users
		and fits <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery">modern
		software development practices</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Online deployment requires the use of a simple artifact repository (also
		called a product market). Only one
		version of an artifact is allowed in a repository so it is common to have
		multiple repositories for different stages of mod development. It is
		recommended to have at least a stable (production quality) repository and
		a latest (development quality) repository.
	</p>
	<p>
		To deploy a mod to a repository both the mod library (also called a product
		pack) and the mod card (also called a product card) must be made available
		in the repository location for the mod. Xenon uses the mod card to
		determine if the mod needs to be updated on user installations so be sure
		the mod card information is updated along with the mod library. Using Maven
		to build your mod will also create an updated mod card.
	</p>
	<p>
		Once the mod is deployed to a repository, add that repository to the Xenon
		Product Markets in the Product tool, if not already added. Once the
		repository is added to the Product Markets, select Available Products in
		the Guide tool and the available products should be refreshed. If all has
		gone well your mod will show in the available products list and it can be
		installed. If an update is deployed to the repository the Xenon update
		functionality will be used to discover and install the update.
	</p>
	<h3 id="manual-deployment">Manual Deployment</h3>
	<p>
		Manual deployment is not the recommended way to deploy mods. It is useful
		for early development purposes but it is not recommended for regular
		deployment. Instead, it is recommended that an automated
		process be set up to post mod releases (both development and production)
		online and use <a href="#online-deployment">online deployment</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		For manual deployment all that is needed is to copy the mod library to a
		mod folder and start, or restart, Xenon. To do
		this, navigate to the <a href="/product/xenon/docs/manual#terminology-program-data-folder">program data folder</a>. In the program
		data folder create a modules folder, if it does not already exist, and
		inside the modules folder create folder for your mod. It does not matter
		what the mod folder name is nor what the jar file name is but it is
		convention to name the mod folder after the Java module name and the jar
		file after the mod name. For example, if your mod's Java module name was
		com.example.mymod the mod path would look like this:
	</p>
	<pre>{program data folder}/modules/com.example.mymod/mymod.jar</pre>
	<p>
		Here is an example using the Mazer project:
	</p>
	<pre>{program data folder}/modules/com.avereon.mazer/mazer.jar</pre>
	<p>
		With the mod now in a mod folder, start or restart Xenon. You can see if it
		loaded or not in the About tool. Open the About tool (from the menu Help >
		About) and select the Mods item in the guide. You should see your mod in the
		list in the About tool. If it does not appear in the list, there may be a
		program notice in the Notice tool or check the program log file for errors.
	</p>

	<h2 id="mod-common-problems">Common Problems</h2>
	<h3 id="missing-resource-exception">Missing Resource Exception</h3>
	<p>
		If you encounter a MissingResourceException, especially when first using
		resource bundles in your mod, it is usually caused due to a missing
		<code>opens</code> statement in the module-info.java file. Be sure to open
		all resource bundle packages.
	</p>
	<p>Here is an example using the Mazer project:</p>
	<pre>module mazer {
  ...
  opens com.avereon.mazer.bundles;
  ...
}</pre>
