	<p>2019-11-28</p>

	<p>
		This document is step-by-step instruction to create a Xenon mod. These
		instructions attempt to be both a tutorial and a reference. If you are
		starting a new mod project we recommend following the instructions in
		order. If you are returning for reference please use the index for the
		topic you need.
	</p>
	<p>
		A reference project, <a href="https://github.com/avereon/mazer">Mazer</a>,
		is also available to provide a working reference of a Xenon mod. As you work
		through these instructions, feel free to review this project for
		information.
	</p>

	<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>

	<h3 id="requirements">Requirements</h3>
	<p>
		Xenon requires Java 11 or higher and usually adopts LTS Java versions as
		they are released. Xenon also takes advantage of the Java module system and
		therefore you mod will also need to be a Java module.
	</p>

	<h3 id="project-setup">Project Setup</h3>
	<p>
		To start a new mod project we recommend that you use Maven, or a Maven
		compatible tool like Gradle, to configure the new mod project using an
		existing parent pom to jump start the process. It is possible to set up a
		mod project without using the parent pom but you would have to handle
		quite a bit of configuration on your own.
	</p>

	<h3 id="maven-configuration">Maven Configuration</h3>

	<p>
		Start with an empty folder for your project and create a new pom.xml file.
		Use the template below as the initial content for the pom.xml file and set
		your own groupId, artifactId and version:
	</p>

	<pre className="code">&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;

&lt;project
  xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/maven-v4_0_0.xsd"
&gt;

  &lt;modelVersion&gt;4.0.0&lt;/modelVersion&gt;

  &lt;parent&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;com.avereon.pom&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;mod&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;3.0.0-SNAPSHOT&lt;/version&gt;
  &lt;/parent&gt;

  &lt;groupId&gt;[your.group.id]&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;[your.artifact.id]&lt;/artifactId&gt;
  &lt;version&gt;[your.version]&lt;/version&gt;
  &lt;packaging&gt;jar&lt;/packaging&gt;

  &lt;-- The Avereon Maven repository --&gt;
  &lt;repositories&gt;
    &lt;repository&gt;
      &lt;id&gt;avn&lt;/id&gt;
      &lt;url&gt;https://repo.avereon.com/avn&lt;/url&gt;
    &lt;/repository&gt;
  &lt;/repositories&gt;

&lt;/project&gt;</pre>

	<p>
		At the same time you can create the source/main/java folders so that the
		project layout looks like this. Note that the 'source' folder is different
		than the standard Maven 'src' folder. This is the only departure from the
		<a href="https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-standard-directory-layout.html">Maven Standard Directory Layout</a>.:
	</p>

	<pre className="code">pom.xml
source/main/java</pre>

	<p>
		At this point you should be able to use Maven to run an initial build even
		though there isn't much to do. It will at least give you the chance to test
		that your configuration is correct.
	</p>

	<h2 id="implementing-the-mod">Implementing the Mod</h2>

	<h3 id="java-module">Java Module</h3>
	<p>
		Create the Java module info file source/main/java/module-info.java. This
		file defines the Java module requirements and will be updated from time to
		time as needs arise. For now we just need the initial configuration:
	</p>
	<pre>module [your java module name] {
  requires com.avereon.xenon;
  exports [your mod class package] to com.avereon.xenon;
  provides com.avereon.xenon.Mod with [your fully qualified mod class name];
}</pre>
	<p>
		Here is an example using the Mazer project:
	</p>
	<pre>module com.avereon.mazer {
  requires com.avereon.xenon;
  exports com.avereon.mazer to com.avereon.xenon;
  provides com.avereon.xenon.Mod with com.avereon.mazer.Mazer;
}</pre>

	<h3 id="mod-class">Mod Class</h3>
	<p>
		Create your module class and extend the com.averon.xenon.Mod class:
	</p>
	<pre>module com.avereon.mazer {
  requires com.avereon.xenon;
  exports com.avereon.mazer to com.avereon.xenon;
  provides com.avereon.xenon.Mod with com.avereon.mazer.Mazer;
}</pre>

	<p>
		Here is an example using the Mazer project:
	</p>
	<pre>package com.avereon.mazer;

import com.avereon.xenon.Mod;

public class Mazer extends Mod {

}</pre>

	<h3 id="module-card">Module Card</h3>
	<p>
		Mods use a small file, called a product card, as a descriptor. Create a new
		JSON text file, source/main/resources/META-INF/product.card, with the
		following content. All the values surrounded by ${...} are replaced by
		Maven at build time. You can update the other values as desired:
	</p>
	<pre>{
  "group": "${project.groupId}",
  "artifact": "${project.artifactId}",
  "version": "${project.version}",
  "timestamp": "${project.timestamp}",
  "packaging": "mod",
  "iconUri": "https://www.avereon.com/download/stable/avereon/provider/icon",
  "name": "${project.name}",
  "provider": "${project.organization.name}",
  "providerUrl": "${project.organization.url}",
  "inception": "${project.inceptionYear}",
  "summary": "[project summary]",
  "description": "${project.description}",
  "copyrightSummary": "All rights reserved.",
  "licenseSummary": "${project.name} comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.",
  "productUri": "https://www.example.com/download/product/pack",
  "mainClass": "com.example.project.ExampleMod",
  "javaVersion": "11",
  "maintainers": [
  {
    "name": "[maintainer name]",
    "email": "[maintainer email]",
    "timezone": "[maintain time zone]",
    "organization": "[provider organization]",
    "organizationUrl": "[provider organization url]",
    "roles": [ "Architect", "Developer" ]
  }
  ],
  "contributors": []
}</pre>

	<h3 id="mod-library">Mod Library</h3>
	<p>
		With the product card in place there is enough implementation to build the
		mod and try it with Xenon. Of course, this mod doesn't do much but it's a
		start. To build the mod, use Maven with the platform-agnostic-assemblies
		profile enabled:
	</p>
	<code>mvn clean package -U -P platform-agnostic-assemblies</code>
	<p>
		If all has gone well there is now a product.jar file in the target folder.
		This file is your mod library.
	</p>
