	<h1>Tool Guide</h1>
	<p>2020-05-15</p>
	<p>
		Tools are at the heart of functionality in Xenon. Without tools Xenon has no
		functionality for users to do any specific work. Tools operate on assets
		(files, connections, etc.) and provide the functionality users need to
		create, view, edit and maintain those assets.
	</p>

	<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
	<p>
		All tools should start by inheriting from the ProgramTool or GuidedTool
		class. ProgramTool provides the required functionality while GuidedTool
		should be used for tools that work in conjunction with the guide tool.
	</p>

	<pre>
public class MyTool extends ProgramTool {

  public MyTool( Program program, Asset asset ) {
    super( program, asset );
  }

}</pre>

	<h2 id="registration">Registering a Tool</h2>
	<p>
		Tools are only useful on assets of certain types. In order to associate a
		tool with the asset types that it can work with it must be registered with
		the program tool manager. It is common for a mod to register both the asset
		type and the tools for the asset type, but it is also possible to register
		tools	for existing asset types.
	</p>
	<p>
		Registering a tool is not trivial as it requires quite a bit of information.
		Below is a code example how to register a tool. The asset type to register
		the tool against can be retrieved from the program asset manager, usually
		with the <a href="/product/xenon/docs/user-guide#terminology-asset-type">asset
		type media type</a>. The tool name should be retrieved from a resource
		bundle and the icon should be retrieved from the program icon library. A
		ToolRegistration object is created to collect all the information and passed
		to the program tool manager to complete the registration. When a mod is
		disabled or uninstalled the tools should also be unregistered.
	</p>
	<pre>
public class MyMod extends Mod {

  public void startup() {
    ...
    registerAssetType( myAssetType = new MyAssetType( this ) );
    ToolRegistration registration = new ToolRegistration( getProduct(), MyTool.class );
    // Optionally set name, icon and instance mode
    registration.setName( name ).setIcon( icon ).setInstanceMode( ToolInstanceMode.UNLIMITED );
    registerTool( myAssetType, registration );
    ...
  }

  public void shutdown() {
    ...
    unregisterTool( myAssetType, MylTool.class );
    unregisterAssetType( myAssetType );
    ...
  }

}</pre>

	<h3 id="update-tool-on-asset-model-changes">
		Update tool on asset model changes
	</h3>
	<p>
		The recommended way to update the tool state when the asset changes is to
		register event handlers on the asset model for the changes the tool needs
		in order to keep the state up-to-date. Registering event handlers directly
		on the asset will provide high-level events, but usually does not provide
		enough information for the tool to make efficient decisions. Event handlers
		on the asset model should be registered as "deep" as reasonable so that the
		handler only has to process as little as possible. <em>Important:</em> Be
		sure to unregister the event handlers when the tool is deallocated.
