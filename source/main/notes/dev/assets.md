# Assets
Assets are the items that ${project.name} views or edits. Assets can be 
almost anything from text files, images, mazes, drawings, etc. However, a
asset type must be registered with ${project.name} to indicate that it is
supported.
 
# Asset Types
Asset types represent internal data models for ${project.name}. While the 
asset type is not the data model, it is a placeholder in the asset
management system for the supported data models. When opening an existing
asset or creating a new asset, the asset type is either specified
or resolved for the asset. The asset type is also associated to the 
codecs that can read or write the data model the asset type represents.
