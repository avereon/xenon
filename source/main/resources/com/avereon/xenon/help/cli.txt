${project.name} is a Java module and as such should be started using the Java
module command line parameters. ${project.name} is also distributed as a jlink-ed
application and should be executed using the provided Java runtime.
To start ${project.name} use the following commands:

  ${PROGRAM_HOME}/bin/java -m ${project.groupId}.${project.artifactId}

It is expected, however, that users use the provided program launchers,
shortcuts and shell scripts such that ${project.name} may simply be started by using
the command '${project.artifactId}' on the command line from any folder. The remainder of
this document will assume that ${project.name} is available to execute in this
manner:

  ${project.artifactId} [<option>...] [<url>...]
